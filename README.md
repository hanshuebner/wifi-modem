# WiFi modem based on Zimodem

This project contains a PCB to turn a ESP-12F microcontroller into a
standalone WiFi modem with status LEDs and a RS-232 interface.  It is
designed to use [Zimodem](https://github.com/bozimmerman/Zimodem) as
firmware.

**Please do not use this PCB at this points.  There are bugs in it that
make it non-functional and I did not find the time to debug it yet.**
